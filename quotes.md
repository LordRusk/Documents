Anarchism \\ Freedom
====================
Some right wing libertarian quotes about anarchism and freedom.

Liberty
-------
Muh freedom

- "Liberty is about our rights to question everything." - Aj WeiWei

	-"The fact is that the average man’s love of liberty is nine-tenths imaginary, exactly like his love of sense, justice and truth. He is not actually happy when free; he is uncomfortable, a bit alarmed, and intolerably lonely. Liberty is not a thing for the great masses of men." - H.L. Mencken

	-"Liberty resides in the rights of that person whose views you find most odious." - John Stuart Mill

	-"None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

	-"If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear." - George Orwell

	-"To be free is nothing, to become free is everything." - Hegel

	-"Monsieur l'abbé, I detest what you write, but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write." — Voltaire

	-"Love allows freedom; not only allows, but strengthens freedom. And anything that destroys freedom is not love." - Osho

	-"Freedom takes a lot of effort." - Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya, Quote found in the dedication of The Peaceful Pill Handbook

Politics
--------
The sheeps intellectual battle

	-"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: There is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics." - Thomas Sowell

	-"It is the responsibility of every citizen to ignore dumb laws." - Ian Clerke

	-"One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results." - Milton Friedman

	-"Revolution is the opium of the intellectuals." - Jerzy Peterkiewicz

	-"The most fundamental fact about the ideas of the political left is that they do not work. Therefore we should not be surprised to find the left concentrated in institutions where ideas do not have to work in order to survive." - Thomas Sowell

	-"The nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them" - George Orwell

	-"Government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have … The course of history shows that as a government grows, liberty decreases." - Thomas Jefferson

	-"I heartily accept the motto, “That government is best which governs least”; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe– “That government is best which governs not at all”; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have." - Henry David Thoreau

	-"The society that puts equality before freedom will end up with neither. The society that puts freedom before equality will end up with a great measure of both." - Milton Friedman

	-"Economic control is not merely control of a sector of human life which can be separated from the rest; it is the control of the means for all our ends. And whoever has sole control of the means must also determine which ends are to be served, which values are to be rates higher and which lower, in short, what men should believe and strive for." - F.A. Hayek

	-"There is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women." - Margaret Thatcher

	-"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice… moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue." - Karl Hess, as Barry Goldwater’s head speechwriter

	-"Liberty is the breath of progress." - Robert Ingersoll

	-"The United States is a nation of laws, poorly written and randomly enforced." - Frank Zappa

	-"Formerly we suffered from crimes; now we suffer from laws." - Publius Cornelius Tacitus

	-"Probably all laws are useless; for good men do not want laws at all, and bad men are made no better by them." - Demonax - (Roman philosopher, circa 150 A.D.)

	-"The more corrupt the republic, the more numerous the laws." - Cornelius Tacitus, 55-117 AD, Roman historian

	-"It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow." - Alexander Hamilton

	-"The more laws and order are made prominent, the more thieves and robbers there will be." - Lao Tsu

	-"There is no logical basis for the prohibition of marijuana. $7.7 billion is a lot of money, but that is one of the lesser evils. Our failure to successfully enforce these laws is responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in Colombia. I haven’t even included the harm to young people. It’s absolutely disgraceful to think of picking up a 22-year-old for smoking pot. More disgraceful is the denial of marijuana for medical purposes." - Milton Friedman

	-"The American Republic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public’s money." - Alexis De Tocqueville

	-"The behavior of any bureaucratic organization can best be understood by assuming that it is controlled by a secret cabal of its enemies." - Robert Conquest’s Second Law of Politics

Government \\ General
---------------------
	-"The direct use of physical force is so poor a solution to the problem of limited resources that it is commonly employed only by small children and great nations." - David Friedman

Taxation
--------
State Mandated Theft

	-"The fact is that the government, like a highwayman, says to a man: Your money, or your life. And many, if not most, taxes are paid under the compulsion of that threat. The government does not, indeed, waylay a man in a lonely place, spring upon him from the road side, and, holding a pistol to his head, proceed to rifle his pockets. But the robbery is none the less a robbery on that account; and it is far more dastardly and shameful. The highwayman takes solely upon himself the responsibility, danger, and crime of his own act. He does not pretend that he has any rightful claim to your money, or that he intends to use it for your own benefit. He does not pretend to be anything but a robber. He has not acquired impudence enough to profess to be merely a "protector," and that he takes men's money against their will, merely to enable him to "protect" those infatuated travellers, who feel perfectly able to protect themselves, or do not appreciate his peculiar system of protection. He is too sensible a man to make such professions as these. Furthermore, having taken your money, he leaves you, as you wish him to do. He does not persist in following you on the road, against your will; assuming to be your rightful "sovereign," on account of the "protection" he affords you. He does not keep "protecting" you, by commanding you to bow down and serve him; by requiring you to do this, and forbidding you to do that; by robbing you of more money as often as he finds it for his interest or pleasure to do so; and by branding you as a rebel, a traitor, and an enemy to your country, and shooting you down without mercy, if you dispute his authority, or resist his demands. He is too much of a gentleman to be guilty of such impostures, and insults, and villainies as these. In short, he does not, in addition to robbing you, attempt to make you either his dupe or his slave." - Lysander Spooner

Capitalism \\ Free Markets
--------------------------
Economics is the painful elaboration of the obvious.

	-"A major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it … gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself." - Miltion Friedman

	-"The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit." - Miltion Friedman

	-The only thing worse than being exploited by capitalism is not being exploited by capitalism." - Joan Violet Robinson

	-"Manufacturing and commercial monopolies owe their origin not to a tendency imminent in a capitalist economy but to governmental interventionist policy directed against free trade and laissez faire." - Ludwig Mises

	-"If an exchange between two parties is voluntary, it will not take place unless both believe they will benefit from it. Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple insight, from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can only gain at the expense of another. - Milton Friedman"

	-"States with central-planning regimes […] do tend to consume much less energy (and much less of everything else) […] than do Americans. There is a word for that: poverty." - The Politically Incorrect Guide to Socialism

	-"When you start paying people to be poor, you wind up with an awful lot of poor people." - Milton Friedman

Intellectual Property
---------------------
Property or ownership of ideas

	-“If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me. That ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.” - Thomas Jefferson

	-“I personally think intellectual property is an oxymoron. Physical objects have a completely different natural economy than intellectual goods. It’s a tricky thing to try to own something that remains in your possession even after you give it to many others.” “Royalties are not how most writers or musicians make their living. Musicians by and large make a living with a relationship with an audience that is economically harnessed through performance and ticket sales.” - John Perry Barlow

	-“Copying isn’t theft, and it isn’t piracy. It’s what we did for millennia until the invention of copyright, and we can do it again, if we don’t hobble ourselves with the antiquated remnants of a censorship system from the sixteenth century.” — Karl Fogel

	-“For one thing, there are many “inventions” that are not patentable. The “inventor” of the supermarket, for example, conferred great benefits on his fellowmen for which he could not charge them. Insofar as the same kind of ability is required for the one kind of invention as for the other, the existence of patents tends to divert activity to patentable inventions.” — Milton Friedman

	-“Oh, dear me, how unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque was that "plagiarism” farce! As if there was much of anything in any human utterance, oral or written, except plagiarism! The kernal, the soul — let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances — is plagiarism. For substantially all ideas are second-hand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them; whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral calibre and his temperament, and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing. When a great orator makes a great speech you are listening to ten centuries and ten thousand men — but we call it his speech, and really some exceedingly smail portion of it is his. But not enough to signify. It is merely a Waterloo. It is Wellington’s battle, in some degree, and we call it his; but there are others that contributed. It takes a thousand men to invent a telegraph, or a steam engine, or a phonograph, or a photograph, or a telephone or any other important thing—and the last man gets the credit and we forget the others. He added his little mite — that is all he did. These object lessons should teach us that ninety-nine parts of all things that proceed from the intellect are plagiarisms, pure and simple; and the lesson ought to make us modest. But nothing can do that.“ – Mark Twain, letter to Helen Keller, after she had been accused of plagiarism for one of her early stories (17 March 1903), published in Mark Twain’s Letters, Vol. 1 (1917) edited by Albert Bigelow Paine, p. 731.
